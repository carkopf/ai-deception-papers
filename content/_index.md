## What This Is

A curated collection of key research papers on AI deception. For each paper, I raise philosophically-motivated questions, explore connections to existing philosophical literature, and identify conceptual puzzles worth thinking through.

This is a project by [Charles Rathkopf](https://charlesrathkopf.net). I'm actively adding analyses to papers in the database.

## Why This Matters

Recent AI systems show sophisticated deceptive capabilities—from alignment faking to in-context scheming. Understanding these behaviors requires not just empirical results, but careful thinking about what deception is, whether AI systems have beliefs, and what rationality demands of systems that operate across contexts.
