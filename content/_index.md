## What This Is

A curated collection of key research papers on AI deception, with philosophically-flavored questions and commentary by [Charles Rathkopf](/about/).

I'm actively adding analyses to papers in the database. Each paper page includes my take on the philosophical puzzles, open questions, and conceptual tensions the work raises.

## Why This Matters

Recent AI systems show sophisticated deceptive capabilities—from alignment faking to in-context scheming. Understanding these behaviors requires not just empirical results, but careful thinking about what deception is, whether AI systems have beliefs, and what rationality demands of systems that operate across contexts.
