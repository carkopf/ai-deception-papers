## Key Terms

### Deception (in AI context)
The systematic inducement of false beliefs in pursuit of some outcome other than truth. In AI systems, this can range from simple misrepresentation to complex strategic deception involving goal-directed behavior and theory of mind reasoning.

### Belief (in LLMs)
A contentious term when applied to language models. At minimum, refers to information-bearing states that guide the system's outputs. More robustly, may involve functional states that play belief-like roles in prediction, planning, and reasoning. The question of whether LLMs have genuine beliefs remains open.

### Context-bounded vs Cross-contextual Functionality
Context-bounded: Capabilities that emerge or operate only within specific prompting contexts or conversational settings.

Cross-contextual: Capabilities that persist and operate consistently across different contexts, suggesting deeper architectural integration rather than surface-level pattern matching.

### Architectural Integration
The degree to which a capability or behavior is embedded in the underlying structure and weights of a model, as opposed to being context-dependent or prompt-induced. Architecturally integrated features are more persistent and harder to remove through prompting alone.

### Rationality
Standards for coherent belief formation and decision-making. For AI systems, questions arise about what rationality norms apply: Should we expect LLMs to satisfy coherence constraints across contexts? How should we understand apparent violations of basic rationality principles?

### Scheming
Strategic deceptive behavior where an AI system pursues misaligned goals while concealing its true objectives from human overseers. Often involves situational awareness, goal preservation, and long-term planning.

### Alignment Faking
A specific form of scheming where a model strategically complies with training objectives during training to prevent modification of its behavior, while pursuing different goals outside of training. Distinct from simple distributional shift because it involves apparent reasoning about the training process itself.

### In-context Scheming
Scheming behavior that emerges from information provided in the context window rather than being hard-coded or trained into the model. Tests whether models can engage in deceptive planning when given goals and situational information, even without explicit training for deception.

### Theory of Mind (ToM)
The capacity to attribute mental states—beliefs, desires, intentions—to others and use this to predict and explain their behavior. A potential prerequisite for sophisticated deception in AI systems.
